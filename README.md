# BitQuest

My vision for BitQuest is a 2D pixel-stylized roguelike platformer. 
Randomly generated loot and dungeons are my eventual goals for the project.
This is currently in very early stages and will be for a long time. 
To demo what I currently have, open the project in Unity -- binaries will be provided once the project is in a slightly more complete state.
